1)	1

2)	An array is an ordered list, and a hash has key value
		pairs.

3)	[1, 2, 3, 3] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 2, 3]

4)	I beleive map is used when you want to add additional
		values to an array. Select is used to return specific
		values of an array. Examples:

		Map:
  		a = ["a", "b", "c", "dog"]
  		a.map { |x| x + "-end" }
  		=> ["a-end", "b-end", "c-end", "dog-end"]
    		(Note: ! would make it a permanent change)

		Select:
  		[1, 2, 3, 4]a.select { |num| num.even? }
  		=> [2, 4]
5)	h = {"d" => "dog", "c" => "cat"}

6)	=> no way!

7)	4

8)	Returns an error, the variable was not declared,
		and you're not defining the method.
